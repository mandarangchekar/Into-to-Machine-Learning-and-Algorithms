## Overview
This repository contains code, reports, datasets, and outputs for homework assignments (HW) from HW01 to HW08. The code for HW01 to HW05 is written in Julia, while Python is used for HW06 to HW08. Each assignment focuses on different algorithms and data manipulation tasks.

## Assignments Description and Summary

### HW0: Data Collection and Manipulation
- **Algorithm**: Data scraping and random data modification.
- **Summary**: Extracted university faculty data from Google Scholar, created and manipulated datasets to include noisy and missing data versions.

### HW1: Missing Value Imputation
- **Algorithm**: Various imputation methods (e.g., mean, median, local gradient).
- **Summary**: Evaluated different imputation methods on missing data to minimize average absolute error.

### HW2: Principal Components Analysis
- **Algorithm**: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for data visualization.
- **Summary**: Used PCA for visualizing data and understanding its utility in predicting citation numbers.

### HW3: Clustering and Prediction
- **Algorithm**: Nearest neighbors and clustering.
- **Summary**: Implemented clustering for prediction of citation numbers and evaluated prediction accuracy.

### HW4: Neural Network Prediction
- **Algorithm**: Neural network (5-3-1 architecture) using backpropagation.
- **Summary**: Developed a neural network model for predicting citation numbers and compared results with HW3.

### HW5: Classification with Neural Network
- **Algorithm**: Neural network (6-6-3 architecture) for classification.
- **Summary**: Classified individuals based on citation ratio using a neural network and evaluated the model.

### HW6: Regression Analysis
- **Algorithm**: Linear and logistic regression.
- **Summary**: Applied regression techniques for prediction and classification, comparing results with previous HWs.

### HW7: Random Forest Classification
- **Algorithm**: Random forest with feature engineering.
- **Summary**: Explored random forest for classification with newly introduced features based on citation data.

### HW8: Classification Using Adaboost
- **Algorithm**: Adaboost algorithm.
- **Summary**: Applied Adaboost for classification and compared its performance with other methods from earlier HWs.
